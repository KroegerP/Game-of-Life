/*
* Project Title:
* - c++ Game of Life (Version 3)
*
* Description:
* This is a textbased game about trying to get the treasure from the 
* cave, and possibly clearing the cave of monsters.
*
* 
*
* There are 6 different locations to search through. each one holding 
* a secret item that could help you on your adventure.
* It utilizes string comparisons in order to determine
*
* Developers:
* - Peter Kroeger - kroegepg@mail.uc.edu
* - Joseph Gardner - gardnjc@mail.uc.edu
*
* Help Received:
* - Ryan Kunkel and Jacob Remm - Talked through the Game of Life 
*                                documentation to understand basics
* 
*
* Special Instructions:
* - There are a few test documents, you can change the contents of
*   the text documents, or change the name of the file it's passing 
*   to the class in the runGame function
* - The first 2 numbers in the text file are the number of rows, followed by number ot columns
* - In the text file, there should be as many 0's or 1's as there would be spaces on te grid
* - Example:
*   5 5
*   0 0 0 0 0
*   0 0 1 0 0
*   0 0 1 0 0           <---- I format it this way so it's easy to manipulate in the file
*   0 0 1 0 0                 
*   0 0 0 0 0
*
*   or
*
*   5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0    <- Hard to manipulate, but works
*
* Developer comments:
* Peter Kroeger:
* Focused on architecture of the base game
* Joesph Gardner:
* Added the Dynamic State rule and organized functions
